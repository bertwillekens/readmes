# Bert Willekens' Email Policy

**The biggest drain on productivity is email.** Reading email, writing email, notifications about email. Email is everywhere nowadays and can ask a lot of our attention. That's why I use this email policy with the goal of keeping email manageable.

- Reading email: 3 times per day (weekends 1 time per day)
- Replying to email: Immediately if possible in less than 3 minutes
- Sending email: All day
- **Need to talk right now? Send a message on WhatsApp, or SMS.** If it's really urgent, you can call me as well.

## Reading Email

Reading email is limited to 3 times per day. During weekends, this is only 1 time per day. Email is a slow means of communication, so you never know for sure if someone will respond immediately. Each work day, I check my email according to the following approximate schedule.

- At the start of the work day
- After lunch
- At the end of the work day

Mind my time zone if I'm in Bangkok, for instance. (Indochina time is UTC+7)

## Replying to Email

Replying to email has become a time-consuming job on some days. To speed things up and to separate the wheat from the chaff, I'm using the following rules.

- If the email addresses me and it is possible to reply in 3 minutes or less: Reply immediately after reading, then archive it.
- If the email addresses me but takes some time to reply to: Note as a task and reply at a later time, then archive it.
- If the email addresses me but is just informative: Read it, then archive it.
- If the email does not address me directly (greeting or by using the _cc_ field): Read it, then archive it.

## Sending Email

Sending email can be done all day.

## Direct Communication

### Calling and Texting

**Contact me on WhatsApp.** Since I'm often abroad, I'm not always reachable by calling or texting my normal phone number. If you need a quick answer, you can reach me on WhatsApp with the same number.

You can find my mobile phone number in my email signature.

### Other Communication Channels

To further protect my productivity, all notifications are turned off. Also those on mobile phones, except for WhatsApp and SMS.

This doesn't mean I will never reply to you on Messenger or Telegram, but chances are it will take a little longer.
